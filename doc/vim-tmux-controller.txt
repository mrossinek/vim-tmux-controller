INTRODUCTION                            *vim-tmux-controller*

The vim tmux controller *VTC* is a plugin that allows one to control tmux from
within vim. The use-case in mind during the development is to control a
designated tmux runner pane to continuously make or test your code.
A future feature will be to send selections from within vim directly to the
tmux pane for execution. This will allow on-the-fly interpretation of
languages such as python.

NOTE: This plugin has only been tested using tmux v2.8 and neovim v0.3.3.

COMMANDS                                *vim-tmux-controller-commands*

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-attach*
*:VtcAttachRunner*        Attaches a runner pane. If vim takes up the only pane
                        in the window, a new one is created. Otherwise the
                        user can specify a pane of his liking.
                        The pane will automatically change into the current
                        working directory of the vim session.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-detach*
*:VtcDetachRunner*        Detaches the runner pane without closing it.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-focus*
*:VtcFocusRunner*         Moves the focus to the runner pane.
                        NOTE: |VTC| plays well with the |vim-tmux-navigator|
                        plugin: (github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator)

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-zoom*
*:VtcZoomRunner*          Zooms into the runner pane. I.e. it resizes the pane
                        to occupy the entire screen. It also prints an info
                        for the user on how to zoom out again.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-kill*
*:VtcKillRunner*          Kills the runner pane, thereby closing it.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-clear*
*:VtcClearRunner*         Clears the runner pane.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-scroll*
*:VtcScrollRunner*        Allows scrolling the runner pane by entering
                        copy-mode. WARNING: You will NOT be able to see your
                        cursor because the vim pane remains the active one.
                        Thus, you should prefer scrolling using `Ctrl+<key>`
                        over movements with `h,j,k,l,w,b,etc.`. Visually
                        selecting is still possible and will give you some
                        idea of where your cursor is.
                        This command is done when pressing `Ctrl+C`.
                        Note: copy-mode will intentionally not be left, in
                        order to be able to see, where one has scrolled too.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-command*
*:VtcSetCommand*          Sets the default command that is send to the runner
                        pane for execution.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-trigger*
*:VtcTriggerCommand*      Triggers the default command for execution. Allows the
                        user to specify a new command, in case no one exists
                        yet.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-quit*
*:VtcQuitCommand*         Quits the running command in the runner pane. First,
                        a TERM signal is sent. If the process does not
                        respond, this is followed by another KILL signal.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-lines*
*:VtcSendLines*           Sends the specified |range| of lines to the runner
                        pane for execution. Mappings are provided for both,
                        |normal| and |visual| mode.

                                        *vim-tmux-controller-file*
*:VtcSendFile*            Sends the whole file to be executed in the runner
                        pane. The executable to be used is determined based on
                        the |filetype|. WARNING: 'filetype' needs to be set
                        for this function to work properly!
                        Note: the executables for the runners are configured
                        via the |g:vtc_runners| dictionary.

Defines the initial default command.

*g:vtc_orientation*                     `Default: ``1`
Defines the orientation of the window split performed when creating a new
runner pane. Note: The possible values are `'1'` which stands for the vim
default of vertical splits and `'0'` which stands for the opposite, horizontal
splits.

*g:vtc_percentage*                      `Default: 0`
Defines wether |g:vtc_pane_size| is given in percentages or absolute units of
measure. Note: The possible values are `0` and `1`.

*g:vtc_pane_width*                      `Default: 85`
Define the default sizes of the runner pane. If |g:vtc_percentage| is set to
true, this value will be interpreted in percent, otherwise it is interpreted
as the absolute value of lines (horizontally) or cells (vertically).

*g:vtc_runners*                         `Default: see below`
Configures the executables used to run whole files. The default values are:
